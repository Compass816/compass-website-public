# Compass

This is the public website component of one of my main projects "Compass".

Compass is a fan-made asset database that's been in development for a few years. Our packs expand to all areas of Sea of Thieves with Screenshots, Promotional Branding, Character and Prop Renders, Background Footage, Concept Art, Overlays, and more! Compass is designed to help Sea of Thieves content creators.

Compass is available at: https://compass-assets.com/

Please note that in no way do I claim any of the assets featured on this website as my own. They are the property of Rare Ltd. and Microsoft are are meerly distributed to aid in others' SoT creations. 
For the full disclaimer: https://compass-assets.com/disclaimer/.

The open source part of this project is the website UI library I designed--parts of which mimic the look of the Sea of Thieves website at https://www.seaofthieves.com. It merely mimics the look, but it is an entirely new UI library except for some images and vectors used around the site, which are a part of the asset collection available to download via Compass -- again, the property of Rare Ltd. and Microsoft.

This project is completely free and only runs on donations.
